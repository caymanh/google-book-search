 ### Description

 Google Book Search is a React-based app that utilizes React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. The app have two pages - Search and Save.
 
 On the Search page, users can search for books via the Google Books API and render them. They have the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database. 
 
 The Save page renders all books saved to the Mongo database. Users have an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.

 The app is built using the MERN stack and utilizes the Google Books API to generate books data.

 The live app can be accessed [here](https://google-book-search-react-based.herokuapp.com/).
